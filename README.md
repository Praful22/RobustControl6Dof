# RobustControl for Aircrafts

### What and Why Robust Control? 

-> Let's explore it throughout this project. 

### Why choose Aircraft? 

--> Because my five sense organs make me excited about any flying creation created by humans (for this project, I choose Aircraft). 

Nose : I love the smell of the engine, the smell that surrounds me when I board a (you name these names) Airlines, the smell of the cockpit, the smell of airframes. Has one ever smelled even the boarding gates or the boarding stairs to an airplane? Oh good god, the aroma around an aircraft!

Skin: I find it super fun to touch the landing gears, softly caress the body (fuselage), jump and pat on the nose cones a.k.a "radomes", and sometimes walk on the wings (this is going to be super controversial, sorry!).

Eyes: Have you ever seen or actually observed an aircraft not through the image(oh, yeah it's an aircraft it is supposed to fly) of it but just the entirety of flying an aircraft? Human eyes are lucky to witness such a creation.

Ears: Sound is the best part! I love the sound of an aircraft. The sound during the ascent and descent of an aircraft. Have you ever even heard from far away what an aircraft engine

Tongue: I've never licked. (PERIOD!) So a blank space _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________. (I might fill the blank space, don't know yet)

Now, that I have paid my homage to these sense organs without which I may barely survive. Let's dive into the fun part.

### Problem Statement

Design a control scheme that works satisfactorily for a system with linear or nonlinear dynamics assuming the worst-case conditions for the "unknowns of unknown" that lie in the system dynamics.

### Intuitive Goals to solve the problem:
Assuming a general design process (ignoring ad hoc designs)
1. All formal and reliable control methods are model-based, so start with the goal **formulating a mathematical model** that closely approximates the process of interest in a selected domain of operation.
2. The model may completely/incompletely cover the dynamics of the real system.(Beware: Model may be error prone)
3. Controller degrades gracefully when subjected to unknown uncertainties. (Highly desirable goal since it becomes the only assurance that the controller would not abruptly break down, if and when the system encounters slightly unprecedented events during its intended operation.)

### Methodologies:
1. Robust Control
2. Adaptive Control 
3. Robust and Adaptive Control (SPECIAL RECIPE) -> https://github.com/Praful22/RobustAdaptiveControl

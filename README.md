# RobustControl for Aircrafts
What and Why Robust Control? 
-> Let's explore it throughout this project. 
Why choose Aircraft? 
--> Because my five sense organs make me excited about any flying creation created by humans (for this project, I choose Aircraft). 
Nose : I love the smell of the engine, the smell that surrounds me when I board a (you name these names) Airlines, the smell of the cockpit, the smell of airframes. Has one ever smelled even the boarding gates or the boarding stairs to an airplane? Oh good god, the aroma around an aircraft!

Skin: I find it super fun to touch the landing gears, softly caress the body frame (airframe), jump and pat on the nose cones a.k.a "radomes", and sometimes walk on the wings (this is going to be super controversial, sorry!).

Eyes: Have you ever seen or actually observed an aircraft not through the image(oh, yeah it's an aircraft it is supposed to fly) of it but just the entirety of flying an aircraft? Human eyes are lucky to witness such a creation.

Ears: Sound is the best part! I love the sound of an aircraft. The sound during the ascent and descent of an aircraft. Have you ever even heard from far away what an aircraft engine

Tongue: I've never licked an aircraft. So a blank space _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________. (I might fill the blank space, don't know yet)

Now, that I have paid my homage to these sense organs without which I may barely survive. Let's dive into the fun part.

### Problem Statement
Design a control scheme that works satisfactorily for a system with linear or nonlinear dynamics assuming the worst-case conditions for the unknowns of unknown which lie in the system dynamics.

### Intuitive Goals to solve the problem:
